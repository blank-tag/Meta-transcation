# Meta-transcation
Meta transactions allow users to perform transactions on the network without directly paying for gas fees. Instead, a relayer or a designated third party covers the gas fees on behalf of the user.

## Description
The Meta Transaction DApp provides a user interface where users can initiate meta transactions by specifying the recipient address and the desired amount to transfer. The application utilizes a backend server to handle the transaction relaying process.

## Features
- Initiate meta transactions without paying gas fees directly
- Specify the recipient address and transfer amount conveniently
- Seamless user experience with gas fees covered by a relayer
